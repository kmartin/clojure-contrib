       :doc "This is a library of string manipulation functions.  It
    is intented as a replacement for clojure.contrib.str-utils.

    You cannot (use 'clojure.contrib.str-utils2) because it defines
    functions with the same names as functions in clojure.core.
    Instead, do (require '[clojure.contrib.str-utils2 :as s]) 
    or something similar.

    Goals:
      1. Be functional
      2. String argument first, to work with ->
      3. Performance linear in string length

    Some ideas are borrowed from
    http://github.com/francoisdevlin/devlinsf-clojure-utils/"}
